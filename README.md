# Google Keep
This project is to develop a React version of Google Keep.

## Development
- Node version is found in the `.nvmrc` file.
- To run the local development server, we are using ParcelJS. Command is `parcel index.html`.

## Git Branching
- All branches will be created off of `main`.
- Each feature branch will be suffixed with `feature/branchname`.
- Each enhancement or bug fix will be suffixed with either `enhancement/branchname` or `bugfix/branchname`.

## Key Integrations
 - Planning to use Squiz Datastore to build the blueprint of the DB and storage of information.
 - Potential to use Squiz Connect to be the middleware for posting data.
